\subsection{Type II quasars}

Implications of our findings on searches for high-redshift type II quasars. 
It could be that type II quasars exist. 
If you look at CIV/MgII the narrow line components are very weak. 
So the contribution from the \ac{BLR} is very weak in luminous quasars, and you just won't see it even if the broad line region is obscured.
Findings in this paper seem to suggest that the static \ac{NLR} is very weak in luminous quasars. 

\todo{Wasn't too sure about what this section was trying to say... Have you considered the \ac{SDSS} Type 2 samples from e.g. Alexandroff et al. ? (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.435.3306A). I thought those were pretty luminous, narrow-line objects?}
