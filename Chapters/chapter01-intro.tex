\section{Discovery}

The first quasar was discovered when it was found that the star-like, thirteenth magnitude objected associated with the radio source 3C 273 was at a cosmological distance \citep[$z=0.158$;][]{schmidt63}. 
This implied an enormous luminosity ($4\times10^{12}$L$_\odot$) for such a compact object and it was quickly realised that energy source was the release of gravitational potential energy as mass is accreted onto a super-massive \marginpar{Super-massive: $10^{6 - 9}$ M$_\odot$} black hole (BH) at the centre of a galaxy \citep[e.g.][]{hoyle63,salpeter64,lynden-bell69,lynden-bell71}.

\section{Basic structure}

An Active Galactic Nucleus\footnote{Throughout this thesis we use the terms `quasar' and `Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)' interchangeably to describe active supermassive black holes, although the term quasar is generally reserved for the luminous (L$_{\rm Bol} > 10^{12}{\rm L}_{\odot}$) subset of AGNs.} (AGN) is significantly more compact than a cubic parsec, and yet can outshine the starlight from an entire galaxy. 
The basic features of the current paradigm explaining this phenomenon are essentially unchanged from \citet{salpeter64}, although many of the details remain unclear.
Material is pulled towards a super-massive BH and sheds angular momentum through viscous and turbulent processes in a hot accretion disc \citep[e.g.][]{begelman85}. 
The accretion disc reaches temperatures of $\sim$$10^6$K, and radiates primarily at ultraviolet (UV) to soft-X-ray wavelengths. 
Hard X-ray originate in a hot corona near the BH, emission lines are produced in rapidly moving clouds of ionised gas and infrared emission is dominated by thermal emission from a dusty, obscuring structure. 
Collimated jets of relativistic plasma and/or associated lobes are also seen in the 10 per cent of quasars that are radio-loud \citep[e.g.][]{peterson97}. 

\subsection{The broad line region}

One of the pre-eminent features of many AGN spectra are broad optical and UV emission lines produced in the {\em broad line region (BLR)}. 
The BLR consists of gas clouds at distances from several light-days to several light-months that are photo-ionised by the ultraviolet continuum emission emanating from the accretion disc.  
Because of the close proximity to the central super-massive BH, bulk motions are dominated by gravity and radiation pressure.
The very broad emission line widths are assumed to Doppler-broadened, and imply line-of-sight velocities of FWHM$\sim$$5000$\kms. 

\subsection{The dusty torus}

Further out, beyond the dust sublimation radius ($\gtrsim10^{17}$cm), are dusty, molecular clouds which are co-planar with the accretion disc. 
These dusty component are generally referred to as the `torus'. 
In a Type II AGN, the accretion disc is observed in an edge-on configuration. 
As a result, emission from the accretion and BLR is obscured by the dusty torus \citep[e.g.][]{antonucci93}.
Although the simple picture shown in Figure~\ref{fig:agnmodel} is a useful staring point, the idea of a torus as a static, doughnut-like structure is almost certainly incorrect. 
For example, the problem of maintaining the thickness of such a structure has long been recognized. 
In one alternative scenario, the torus is the dusty part of an accretion disc wind that provides the required toroidal obscuration \citep[e.g.][]{konigl94,everett09,gallagher12,everett05,keating12,elitzur06}. 

\subsection{The narrow line region}

Further away from the central BH and beyond the dusty torus is the narrow emission line region (NLR). 
Like the BLR, the NLR is ionised by radiation from the central source. 
Unlike the BLR, densities in the NLR are low enough that forbidden transitions are not collisionally suppressed. 
Emission line widths are typically hundreds of \kms. 
The NLR is sufficiently extended to be spatially resolved. 
Observations reveal the illumination to be bi-conical, most likely due to the torus. 
Outflowing gas is also common.  

\section{Winds and outflows in AGN}

Quasars are very powerful sources of radiation, and are embedded in matter-rich environments at the centres of galaxies.
Strong winds, driven by some combination of gas pressure, radiation pressure due to dust or lines, and magnetic forces, are to be expected under these conditions \citep[e.g.][]{blandford82b,proga00,everett05}. 
In line with these expectations, outflows are very commonly observed around quasars. 

Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of outflows in quasars are broad absorption features in the ultra-violet resonance lines of highly ionised \ion{N}{V}, \ion{C}{IV} and \ion{Si}{IV} which are observed in broad absorption line quasars \citep[BALQSOs;][]{weymann91}. 
BALs are always blueshifted, and are evidence for fast outflows with velocities as large as 60\,000 \kms \citep[e.g.][]{turnshek88}. 
The observed \ion{C}{IV} BALQSO fraction in radio-quiet quasars is $\sim15$ per cent \citep[e.g.][]{hewett03,reichard03} and the intrinsic fraction has been estimated at $40$ per cent \citep{allen11}.
The blueshifting of high-ionisation lines in the BLR (including \ion{C}{IV}) also appears to be nearly ubiquitous in the quasar population \citep[e.g.][]{richards02,richards11}, suggesting winds are even more common.
Outflows are also used to explain narrow UV and X-ray absorption lines (NALs) which are seen in $\sim60$ per cent of Seyfert 1 galaxies \citep{crenshaw99} and some quasars \citep[e.g.][]{hamann97}. 
The wide range of emission and absorption line phenomena can be explained in disc wind models \citep[e.g.][]{murray95,elvis00,proga00,everett05}

Models of galaxy evolution that invoke AGN feedback require these outflows to reach galactic scales and quench star formation in the AGN host galaxies. 
In recent years, a huge amount of resources have been devoted to searching for observational evidence of these galaxy-wide, AGN-driven outflows. 
This has resulted in recent detections of outflows in AGN-host galaxies using tracers of atomic, molecular, and ionised gas \citep[e.g.][]{nesvadba06,arav08,nesvadba08,moe09,dunn10,alexander10,harrison12,harrison14,nesvadba10,rupke13,veilleux13,nardini15,feruglio10,alatalo11,cimatti13,cicone14}.  


{\it Broad absorption line quasars} (BALQSOs) are a sub-population of quasars exhibiting blue-shifted absorption troughs broader than 2000 \kms \citep{weymann91} which are unambiguously associated with AGN-driven out-flowing gas. 
As well as showing high rates of mergers, an anomalously large fraction of heavily reddened objects exhibit broad blue-shifted absorption troughs in their spectra \citep{urrutia09, glikman12}. 
This observation suggests that the BAL phenomenon may be related to a `blow-out' phase of a quasars lifetime as it transitions from a dusty, obscured objected to a luminous blue quasar, at the same time quenching star formation. 
Since outflows are believed to be fundamental to AGN feedback, a better understanding of their properties could shed light on the outflow phenomenon. 


\section{SDSS and the era of survey astronomy}


 

Observations of broad velocity-widths and blueshifts in narrow emission lines stretch back several decades \citep[e.g.][]{weedman70,stockton76,heckman81,veron81,feldman82,heckman84,vrtilek85,whittle85,boroson92}. 
However, these studies rely on small samples, which are often unrepresentative of the properties of the population. 
More recently, the advent of large optical spectroscopic surveys (e.g. SDSS) have facilitated studies of the NLR in tens of thousands of AGN \citep[e.g.][]{boroson05,greene05a,zhang11,mullaney13,zakamska14,shen14}. 
This has provided constraints on the prevalence and drivers of ionised outflows.   
At the same time, there is strong evidence from spatially resolved spectroscopic observations that these outflows are extended over galaxy scales \citep[e.g.][]{greene09,greene11,hainline13,harrison12,harrison14}. 

However, these studies do not cover the redshift range when star formation and BH accretion peaked, and consequently when feedback is predicted to be strongest. 
At these redshifts the bright optical emission lines are redshifted to near-infrared wavelengths, where observations are much more challenging. 
As a consequence, studies at high redshifts have typically relied on relatively small numbers of objects \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,sulentic04,shen16a}.
These studies find [\ion{O}{III}] to be broader in more luminous AGN, suggesting that AGN efficiency in driving galaxy-wide outflows increases with luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,nesvadba08,kim13,brusa15,carniani15,perna15,bischetti16}. 
The fraction of objects with very weak [\ion{O}{III}] emission alsp appears to increase with redshift and/or luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04}. 

Other recent studies have looked at the [\ion{O}{III}] emission properties of extreme objects - e.g. heavily obscured quasars \citep{zakamska16} and the most luminous quasars \citep{bischetti16} - at redshifts $z\sim2$. 
The [\ion{O}{III}] emission in these objects is extremely broad and strongly blueshifted. 
These observations are consistent with galaxy formation models that predict AGN feedback to be strongest in luminous, dust-obscured quasars.














\section{The AGN-host galaxy connection}

Super-massive BHs are found at the centres of most nearby massive galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{kormendy95,ferrarese05,kormendy13}.
Remarkably, given their spatial scales differ by many orders of magnitude, the BH mass and mass of the host galaxy spheroid are strongly correlated \citep{ferrarese00,gebhardt00,graham01,tremaine02,marconi03,aller07,gultekin09}.  
Although any underlying causal mechanism(s) responsible for the correlation is yet to be conclusively identified, there is considerable observational and theoretical support for a `feedback' relationship in which the energy output from rapidly accreting BHs (in a quasar phase) couples with the gas in the host galaxy and quenches star formation \citep[e.g.][]{silk98,king03,dimatteo05,king15}. 

Quasar feedback has also been invoked to explain the similarity of the cosmic BH accretion and star formation histories.
The number density of quasars, which evolves strongly with redshift, peaks at redshifts $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$ \citep[e.g.][]{brandt05,richards06b} and the most massive (M$_\bullet \gtrsim 10^9\msun$) present-day BHs experienced much of their growth during this epoch.  
The star formation rate, which closely follows the cosmological evolution of the quasar luminosity function, also peaks during this epoch \citep[e.g.][]{boyle98}. 
Quantifying the growth-rate of massive BHs at $2 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$ would therefore help significantly in understanding the role quasars play in galaxy evolution.

\section{Measuring black hole masses}

As one of just two fundamental quantities describing a BH on astrophysical scales, the mass is of crucial importance to virtually all areas of quasar science, including the evolution and phenomenology of quasars, and accretion physics.
The power output of quasars is directly proportional to the BH mass. 
There is much debate regarding what effect the energy output by quasars has on evolution and structure of the host galaxy. 

The masses of BHs in many local, inactive galaxies have been measured by dynamical modelling spatially resolved kinematics. 
However, this requires the sphere-of-influence of the BH, $R_{\rm BH}$, to be resolved. 
\marginpar{$R_{\rm BH} = \frac{2GM_{\rm BH}}{\sigma\ast}$} 
With masses only $\sim$0.1 per cent of the stellar masses of the host galaxies, $R_{\rm BH}\sim1-100$ pc.
With current instrumentation, resolving this region is only possible in very close by, inactive galaxies. 

The reverberation mapping method, first proposed by \citet{blandford82a}, uses the time delay between continuum variations and emission-line variations to estimate the size of the BLR. 
Because it depends on temporal resolution rather than spatial resolution, it can applied out to much greater distances. 

\subsection{Reverberation mapping}


Continuum variability is a common characteristic of quasars. 
Because the BLR is photo-ionized by the continuum, the broad emission lines also vary with some characteristic lag, which is related to the light travel time across the BLR. 
The reverberation mapping technique uses the time lag between variations in the continuum emission and correlated variations in the broad line emission to measure the typical size of the BLR. 
Today RM has become a practical and powerful tool to study BLRs (see reviews by, e.g., Peterson 1993; Netzer \& Peterson 1997; Horne et al. 2004). 

Under the assumptions that the BLR dynamics are virialised and the gravitational potential is dominated by the BH, the BH mass is simply given by the product of the typical BLR radius and the square of the virial velocity of the BLR clouds. 
In practice, reverberation mapping relies on dense spectrophotometric monitoring campaigns which span many years. 
The typical velocity in he BLR is measured from the width of he broad \hb lines in the RMS spectra, ensuring that only the variable part of the line contributes to the line width calculation. 
Since the structure and geometry of the BLR is unknown, a virial coefficient $f$ is introduced to transform the observed line-of-sight velocity inferred from the line width in to a virial velocity. 
In practice, the value of is empirically determined by requiring that the derived masses are consistent with those predicted from the M-$\sigma$ relation for local inactive galaxies. 
Although this technique has proved to be effective, because it relies on resource-intensive spectro-photometric monitoring campaigns, masses have been derived for only $\sim50$ AGN, all at low redshifts $z\lesssim0.3$. 
There are now several dozens of AGNs and quasars (most are at redshifts $z<0.3$) with average lag measurements \citep[e.g.][]{kaspi00,peterson04,bentz09,denney10,barth11,grier12}. 
The current sample is strongly biased toward relatively low-luminosity AGNs, mostly nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies.
A number of Palomar-Green (Schmidt \& Green 1983) quasars are included, but the highest-redshift
source studied is only at z = 0.29 (PG 1700+518).
The uncertainty in the reverberation-mapping masses is $\sim0.4-0.5$ dex \citep[e.g.][]{peterson10}.

If the line-emitting clouds in the broad line region (BLR) are assumed to be virialised and moving in a potential dominated by the central BH, then the BH mass is simply a product of the BLR size and the square of the virial velocity (give equation)
The reverberation-mapping technique uses the time lag between variations in the continuum emission and correlated variations in the broad line emission to measure the typical size of the BLR \citep{peterson93,peterson14}. 
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) or dispersion ($\sigma$; derived from the second moment) velocity of the prominent broad emission line of \hb (4862.7\AA)\footnote{Vacuum wavelengths are employed throughout the thesis.} 
is used as an indicator of the virial velocity, with extensions to other low-ionization emission lines such as \ha (6564.6\AA) and \ion{Mg}{II}\ll2796.4,2803.5 \citep[e.g.][]{vestergaard02,mclure02,wu04,kollmeier06,onken08,wang09,rafiee11}.
\marginpar{FWHM: Full width of the line profile at half of maximum intensity}
Extensive reverberation mapping campaigns have provided accurate BH masses for $\sim$50 active galactic nuclei (AGN) at relatively low redshifts and of modest luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{kaspi00,kaspi07,peterson04,bentz09,denney10}. 

\subsection{Single-epoch virial estimates}

Single-epoch virial BH mass estimates normally take the form

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:virialmass}
  \mathrm{M_{BH}} = 10^{a} \left( \frac{\Delta V}{1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}} \right)^b \left[ \frac{L_{\lambda}}{10^{44}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}} \right]^c
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\Delta V$ is a measure of the line width (from either the FWHM or dispersion), $L_\lambda$ is the monochromatic continuum luminosity at wavelength $\lambda$, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients, determined via calibration against a sample of AGN with reverberation-mapping BH mass estimates. Several calibrations have been derived using different lines (e.g. \hbns, \ion{Mg}{II}, \ion{C}{IV}) and different measures of the line width (FWHM or dispersion) \citep[e.g.][]{vestergaard02,mclure02,vestergaard06,mcgill08,wang09,rafiee11,park13}.

Reverberation mapping campaigns have also revealed a tight relationship between the radius of the BLR and the quasar optical (or ultraviolet) luminosity \citep[the $R-L$ relation; e.g.][]{kaspi00,kaspi07}.
The emission-line spectrum from an ionized gas, setting aside elemental abundances,
is largely controlled by the particle density n and an ionization parameter

\begin{equation}
U = \frac{Q(H)}{4{\pi}R^2nc}
\end{equation}

where Q(H) is the number of hydrogen-ionizing photons emitted per second by the central
object. To some low order of approximation (principally ignoring the Baldwin Effect), all
AGN spectra have similar emission-line flux ratios and similar emission-line equivalent
widths, suggesting that U and n do not vary much from one source to another. If we
further assume that Q(H)$\propto$ L where L is the luminosity of the central source in some
arbitrary band, we are led to the naive prediction that R $\propto$ L1/2 .

An advantage of the technique is that it is inexpensive in telescope time. A single spectrum yields a mass measurement. 
This relation provides a much less expensive method of measuring the BLR radius, and large-scale studies of AGN and quasar demographics have thus become possible through the calibration of single-epoch virial-mass estimators using the reverberation-derived BH masses \citep[e.g.][]{greene05b,vestergaard06,vestergaard09,shen11,shen12,trakhtenbrot12}.
The uncertainties in reverberation mapped BH masses are estimated to be $\sim 0.4$ dex \citep[e.g.][]{peterson10}, and the uncertainties in virial masses are similar \citep[e.g.][]{vestergaard06}.
Since the structure and geometry of the BLR is unknown, a virial coefficient $f$ is introduced to transform the observed line-of-sight velocity inferred from the line width in to a virial velocity.
This simplification accounts for a significant part of the uncertainty in virial BH masses \citep[in addition to, for example, describing the BLR with a single radius $R$ and scatter in the $R-L$ relation;][]{shen13}. 
By far the biggest uncertainty is the virial coefficient f . 
It is unknown, and it probably varies from source to source.
A spherical distribution of clouds on random, isotropic orbits has f = 3/4 for $\Delta$V = FWHM and
f = 3 for $\Delta$V = $\sigma$ (Netzer 1990).
Furthermore, if the BLR is anisotropic \citep[for example, in a flattened disk; e.g.][]{jarvis06} then the line width will be orientation-dependent \citep[e.g.][]{runnoe13b,shen14,brotherton15}. 

For example, single epoch estimates have been used to calculate black hole masses in the highest redshift quasars to study the growth of SMBHs. 
This figure shows a compilation of SE mass estimates for quasars over a wide redshift range from different studies. 
These studies show that massive, $10^9$ BHs are probably already in place by $z\sim7$, when the age of the Universe is less than 1 Gyr.
The fact that a SMBH exists in a quasar at such high redshift is of great importance in physics.
The high redshift means that it was already there when our universe was very young, only about
800 million years old. And the fact that a SMBH was able to grow up in such a short time put
some very tight constraints upon both the cosmological parameters and the accretion history of the
SMBH itself (Willott et al. 2003).

Single epoch masses have also been used to study the distribution of quasars in the BH mass-luminosity plane, which conveys important information about the accretion process of these active black holes (e.g. Kollmeier et al. 2016). 
Redshift evolution of BH-bulge scaling relations (e.g. Bennert et al. 2011). 
Clustering (Shen \& Ho 2014; Timins et al.?). 
With the R–L relationship, we are able to explore the black hole mass function, not only locally but at high redshift, enabling us to trace the history of black hole growth.
Some exploratory work has been done on this and in fact there are claims that the M-sigma relation evolves over time. 
Estimates of such masses are important with respect to the relation between the MBH in the center of a stellar spheroid and the velocity dispersion. 


We emphasize that application of single-epoch spectroscopy to quasars rests on the untested assumption that machinery which is calibrated for sub-Eddington BHs with M$\sim10^7$ still works for BHs with masses up to $10^{10}$ that radiate near the Eddington limit. 
Refer forward to problems with \ion{C}{IV} (Chapter 3)


Throughout this thesis we adopt a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $h_0=0.71$, $\Omega_M=0.27$, and $\Omega_\Lambda=0.73$. 
All wavelengths and equivalent width measurements are given in the quasar rest-frame, and all emission line wavelengths are given as measured in vacuum.



 
\section{SEDs}

\ac{AGN} emit strongly over many decades in frequency. 
At different frequencies, the emission originates from processes occurring in different regions of the \ac{AGN}. 
Hard X-ray emission is dominated by Compton up-scattering of accretion disk photons by electrons in a hot corona \citep[e.g.][]{sunyaev80}, \ac{UV}/optical by thermal accretion disc emission, \ac{IR} by dust at a wide range of temperatures, and radio by synchrotron emission in relativistic jets.   

Significant diversity is observed in the \ac{SED}s of individual objects. 
However, the systematic study of the dependence of the \ac{SED} shape on physical parameters has, until very recently, been limited by the difficulty in obtaining a large sample of quasars with good multi-wavelength coverage and large dynamic range in luminosity and redshift. 
However, we are able to take advantage of a number of recent, sensitive, wide-field photometric surveys, including SDSS (in the UV/optical), UKIDSS (in the \ac{NIR}) and WISE (in the mid-infrared).
We will combine this information with the \ac{BH} mass and mass-normalised accretion rate estimates and outflow diagnostics which we developed in Chapters~\ref{ch:bhmass} and \ref{ch:nlr}. 
We will determine whether there are \ac{SED}-related systematics as a function of outflow signatures and \ac{BH} mass or Eddington ratio. 

Since the physical processes that power \ac{AGN} are generally understood only qualitatively, almost all \ac{AGN} \ac{SED} templates are empirical. 
The empirical template of \citet{elvis94} is still the most commonly cited, despite many additions and updates \citep[e.g.][]{polletta00, kuraszkiewicz03, risaliti04, richards06,  polletta07, lusso10, shang11, marchese12, trichas12}. 
However, these composite spectra are often constructed from quasars with a huge range in luminosity as a function of wavelength. 
In addition, the presence of significant host galaxy at optical wavelengths in low-redshift objects is an additional complication which has not always been taken care of adequately. 
There is therefore a strong rationale for taking a parametric approach to modelling quasar \ac{SED}s. 
This is the approach we take in this chapter. 


\section{Summary / what I need to get across}

It's a data rich time.
SDSS has been revolutionary - shown the power of large surveys. 
We have wide-field photometry in a number of bands - important because AGN emit strongly over many decades in frequency. 
With spectra from SDSS we can derive BH masses and outflow properties from optical lines. 
But these are shifted to infrared wavelengths at redshifts > 1, when things get interesting. 
Increasing availability of infrared-spectra. 
Looking to the future, huge spectroscopic surveys - WEAVE, 4MOST. 

Quasar black hole masses: \citet{shen13}, \citet{peterson10}, \citet{peterson11}, \citet{vestergaard11}, \citet{marziani12}. 
This has motivated a considerable amount of observational work searching for feedback signatures \citep[for recent reviews, see][]{alexander12,fabian12,heckman14}.

% Recently, two sets of observations have allowed us to gain a better understanding of

% velocity wide–angle winds emanating from the vicinity of the SMBH, which have been
% detected in a large fraction of AGNs (Tombesi et al. 2010a,b); and detection of kpc–
% scale quasi–spherical outflows in active galaxies, with enough power and mass flow to
% sweep their host galaxies clear of gas (Feruglio et al. 2010; Rupke & Veilleux 2011;
% Sturm et al. 2011; Riffel & Storchi-Bergmann 2011a,b).


% The unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGNs;
% Antonucci 1993; Urry & Padovani 1995) has been sufficiently
% successful enough that it is tempting to think of luminous
% quasars as being well described by a static model in which the
% only free parameters are the presence or absence of radio jets
% and the angle of our line of sight to the central engine. Indeed, in
% the average sense, quasar spectra are sufficiently similar enough
% that the use of composite spectra (e.g., Francis et al. 1991; Van-
% den Berk et al. 2001) can be very effective. 
% Nevertheless, there
% is a large range of continuum, emission, and absorption prop-
% erties among quasars, which demands that quasars cannot be
% fully described by a single, static picture. Quasars are not things
% so much as processes—they are what happens when the central
% black hole (BH) at the centers of massive galaxies is actively
% accreting new material (e.g., Lynden-Bell 1969).


% At low redshift, the parameters that best characterize the
% diversity of broad emission-line region (BELR) properties are
% the FWHM of the Hβ emission line and the strength of optical
% Fe ii with respect to Hβ (with [O iii] being anti-correlated with
% Fe ii). These parameters were identified as part of the landmark
% study of Boroson & Green (1992, hereafter BG92) using a prin-
% cipal component analysis (PCA) to identify those features that
% cause the largest variance in the spectra of quasars. The first
% two eigenvectors of this PCA decomposition are generally re-
% ferred to as “eigenvector 1” (EV1) and “eigenvector 2” (EV2).
% Eddington ratio thought to be the primary driver of EV1. 


% At high redshift, two well-known properties of the C iv
% emission line are evident in quasar spectra (see Section 4). An
% anti-correlation between luminosity and the equivalent width
% (EQW) of C iv, generally known as the Baldwin Effect (BEff;
% Baldwin 1977), was first identified in 20 (mostly radio-loud
% (RL)) quasars and has been confirmed in much larger samples
% (e.g., Wu et al. 2009). The other effect is the blueshifting of
% the C iv with respect to the systemic redshift (Gaskell 1982;
% Wilkes 1984). As with the BEff, these blueshifts have not only
% been confirmed with larger samples, but appear to be nearly
% ubiquitous in the quasar population (Sulentic et al. 2000b;
% Richards et al. 2002a).
