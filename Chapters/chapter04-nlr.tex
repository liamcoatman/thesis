\section{[\ion{O}{III}] as a probe of quasar-driven outflows}

X-ray and ultra-violet spectroscopy has revealed high-velocity outflows to be nearly ubiquitous in high accretion rate quasars.
Strong evidence for high-velocity outflows in the vicinity of quasars include BALs, NALs and blueshifted emission-lines. 
These observations suggest that the energy released by quasars can have a dramatic effect on their immediate environments. 

Quasars driving powerful outflows over galactic scales are a crucial feature of many galaxy evolution models involving `quasar' feedback \citep[e.g.][]{silk98,king03,dimatteo05,king15}.
In recent years, a huge amount of resources have been devoted to searching for observational evidence of this phenomenon.  
This has resulted in recent detections of outflows in quasar-host galaxies using tracers of atomic, molecular, and ionised gas \citep[e.g.][]{nesvadba06,arav08,nesvadba08,moe09,dunn10,alexander10,harrison12,harrison14,nesvadba10,rupke13,veilleux13,nardini15,feruglio10,alatalo11,cimatti13,cicone14}.  

One particularly successful technique has been to use forbidden quasar emission-lines to probe the dynamical state of the gas in the quasar host-galaxy. 
Even without spatial information, forbidden lines are produced in low-density gas which is generally assumed to be extended over $\gtrsim$\,kilo-parsec scales. 
Because of its high equivalent width, [\ion{O}{III}]\ll$4960,5008$ is the most studied of the narrow quasar emission-lines. 
The [\ion{O}{III}] emission is found to consist of two distinct components: a narrow, `core' component, with a velocity close to the systemic redshift of the host-galaxy, and a broader `wing' component, which is normally blueshifted. 
The general consensus is that the core component is dominated by the gravitational potential of the host-galaxy whereas the broad, blueshifted wing traces outflowing gas. 
The relative balance between the core and wing components varies significantly from object to object, and may depend on properties of the qusaar \citep[e.g. luminosity;][]{shen14}. 

Observations of broad velocity-widths and blueshifts in narrow emission-lines stretch back several decades \citep[e.g.][]{weedman70,stockton76,heckman81,veron81,feldman82,heckman84,vrtilek85,whittle85,boroson92}. 
However, these studies rely on small samples, which are often unrepresentative of the properties of the quasar population. 
More recently, the advent of large optical spectroscopic surveys (e.g. SDSS) have facilitated studies of the NLR in tens of thousands of quasar \citep[e.g.][]{boroson05,greene05a,zhang11,mullaney13,zakamska14,shen14}. 
This has provided constraints on the prevalence and drivers of ionised outflows.   
At the same time, there is strong evidence from spatially resolved spectroscopy that these outflows are extended over galaxy scales \citep[e.g.][]{greene09,greene11,hainline13,harrison12,harrison14}. 

However, these studies do not cover the redshift range when star formation and BH accretion peaked ($2 \lesssim z \lesssim 4$), which is when quasar feedback is predicted to be at its most effective.  
At these redshifts bright optical emission-lines including the [\ion{O}{III}] doublet are redshifted to near-infrared wavelengths, where observations are much more challenging. 
As a consequence, studies at high redshifts have typically relied on relatively small numbers of objects \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,sulentic04,shen16a}.
These studies find [\ion{O}{III}] to be broader in more luminous quasar, suggesting that quasar efficiency in driving galaxy-wide outflows increases with luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,nesvadba08,kim13,brusa15,carniani15,perna15,bischetti16}. 
The fraction of objects with very weak [\ion{O}{III}] emission also appears to increase with redshift and/or luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04}. 

Other recent studies have looked at the [\ion{O}{III}] emission properties of extreme objects - e.g. heavily obscured quasars \citep{zakamska16} and the most luminous quasars \citep{bischetti16} - at redshifts $z\sim2$. 
When detected, the [\ion{O}{III}] emission in these objects is extremely broad and strongly blueshifted. 
These observations are consistent with galaxy formation models that predict quasar feedback to be strongest in luminous, dust-obscured quasars \citep[e.g.][]{sanders88}. 

In this chapter we analyse the [\ion{O}{III}] properties of a sample of $354$ high-luminosity, redshift $1.5 < z < 4$ quasars.
To date, this is the largest study of the NLR properties of high redshift quasars. 

\section{Constructing a quasar sample with [\ion{O}{III}] spectra}

From our near-infrared spectroscopic catalogue (Chapter~\ref{ch:nirsample}), we have selected $354$ quasars which have spectra covering the [\ion{O}{III}] doublet. 
The broad Balmer \hb line has also been observed for all but two of the sample. 
For $165$ quasars, the spectra extend to the broad \ha emission-line at $6565$\,\AA, and in $260$ objects optical spectra, including \ion{C}{IV}, are also available (mostly from SDSS/BOSS). 
The sample covers a wide range in redshifts ($1.5 \lesssim z \lesssim 4$) and luminosities ($45.5 \lesssim \log L_{\mathrm Bol} \lesssim 49$\,\ergs). 
The spectrographs and telescopes used to obtain the near-infrared spectra are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:specnums_ch4}.

\section{Parametric model fits}

In this section, we describe how emission-line parameters are derived. 
Our approach is to model the spectra using a power-law continuum, an empirical \ion{Fe}{II} template (taken from \citealt{boroson92}) and multiple Gaussian components to model the emission from the broad and narrow emission-line regions.
Non-parametric properties are then derived from the best-fitting model. 
This approach, which is commonly adopted in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{shen11,shen12,shen16a}, is more robust when analysing spectra with limited S/N (in comparison to measuring line properties directly from the data) and allows different emission-lines to be de-blended.

The same approach was used to model the \hbns/[\ion{O}{III}] complex in Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}. 
However, a number of small adjustments have been made to the model (Section~\ref{sec:oiiimodel}). 
\ha emission-line properties (used to estimate the quasar systemic redshift) are also re-derived in this chapter using a slightly modified model (Section~\ref{sec:hamodel}) to the one adopted in Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}. 
\ion{C}{IV} emission-line properties (used to infer the strength of BLR outflows) are taken directly from Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}. 

\subsection{Transforming spectra to the quasar rest-frame}

Before a spectrum can be modelled, it must first be transformed to the rest-frame of the quasar.  
The redshift used in this transformation is either derived from the peak of the broad \ha emission ($\sim40$ per cent of our sample), from the peak of the broad \hb emission ($\sim40$ per cent) or from the peak of the narrow [\ion{O}{III}] emission ($20$ per cent).
The rest-frame transformation is only required to be accurate to within $\sim1000$\,\kms\, of the systemic redshift for our fitting procedure to work. 
In later sections, more precise estimates of the systemic redshift will be calculated using our parametric model fits. 

\subsection{Removing \ion{Fe}{II} emission}

Spectra have been smoothed via convolution with a $100$\,\kms\, Gaussian kernel. The vertical lines indicate the expected positions of the [\ion{O}{III}] doublet (which is generally very weak) with the systemic redshift defined using the peak of the broad \hb emission.}

\end{figure}


\ion{Fe}{II} emission is generally strong in the vicinity of \hbns/[\ion{O}{III}]. 
Therefore, before \hbns/[\ion{O}{III}] is modelled, we first model and subtract the continuum and \ion{Fe}{II} emission using the procedure described in Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}. 

We encountered $24$ objects for which the procedure failed to adequately remove the \ion{Fe}{II} emission of the spectra (Figure~\ref{fig:bad_fe}).  
In these objects the relative strengths of the \ion{Fe}{II} lines differ significantly from those of I Zw $1$, on which the \citet{boroson92} \ion{Fe}{II} template we use is based. 
The residual \ion{Fe}{II} emission is at rest-frame wavelengths very close to the zero-velocity wavelengths of the [\ion{O}{III}] doublet, which is generally very weak in these objects. 
As a result, the [\ion{O}{III}] line parameters we derive for these objects are unreliable. 
These objects are flagged and excluded from our analysis in the remainder of this chapter (leaving $330$ objects in our sample). 

To illustrate the importance of the \ion{Fe}{II} subtraction procedure in reliably measuring [\ion{O}{III}] emission properties, we consider the object J$223819$-$092106$. 
This is shown in the bottom row of Figure~\ref{fig:bad_fe}, and was also analysed by \citet{shen16a}.
\citet{shen16a}, employing a very similar model to the one we adopt, reported the [\ion{O}{III}] emission to have an extreme redshift ($\sim7500$\,\kms) relative to the \citet{hewett10} systemic redshift.
However, our analysis suggests that the emission which was modelled by \citet{shen16a} as [\ion{O}{III}] is more likely to be poorly-subtracted \ion{Fe}{II}.  

\subsection{Modelling \hbns/[\ion{O}{III}]}
\label{sec:oiiimodel}

The \hb and [\ion{O}{III}] emission is fit using a similar procedure to the one described in Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}. 
However, we make a number of modifications to the parametric model employed, which we will now describe. 

\subsubsection{\hb}

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \footnotesize 
  \caption{Summary of models used to fit the \hb emission, and the number of quasars each model is applied to.}
  \label{tab:hbmod}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc} 
    \hline
    Model & Fix centroids? & Number \\
    \hline
    $2$ broad Gaussians + $1$ narrow Gaussian & No & $9$ \\
    $2$ broad Gaussians & No  &  $274$ \\
    $2$ broad Gaussians & Yes &  $39$ \\
    $1$ broad Gaussian  & N/A &  $8$ \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table} 

In general, \hb is modelled with two Gaussians with non-negative amplitudes and FWHM greater than $1200$\,\kms.
In $10$ objects \hb is modelled with a single Gaussian and in $41$ objects \hb is modelled with two Gaussians, but the velocity centroids of the two Gaussians are constrained to be equal. 
These spectra generally have low S/N, and adding extra freedom to the model does not significantly decrease the  reduced-$\chi^2$.
In addition there are cases where the blue wing of the \hb emission is below the lower wavelength limit of the spectra; in these cases models with more freedom are insufficiently constrained by the data.    

Contributions to the \hb emission from the NLR is generally weak in our sample, and an additional Gaussian component to model this emission is not required for the vast majority of objects. 
In nine objects features in the model - data residuals suggest that a narrow emission component is significant, and an additional narrow Gaussian is included for these quasars. 
If the NLR contribution to the \hb emission is significant in more of our sample, then measures of the \hb velocity-width will be biased to lower values. 
However, our systemic redshift estimates that use the peak of the \hb emission (Section~\ref{sec:ch4_redshifts}) will not be affected. 
The \hb models, and the numbers of quasars each model is applied to, are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:hbmod}. 

\subsubsection{[\ion{O}{III}]}

Each component of the [\ion{O}{III}] doublet is fit with one or two Gaussians, depending on the fractional reduced-$\chi^2$ difference between the one- and two-component models. 
Concretely, if the addition of the second Gaussian decreases the reduced-$\chi^2$ by more than 5 per cent then the double-Gaussian model is accepted.
One hundred and twenty-eight spectra are fit with a single Gaussian and $140$ with two Gaussians. 
The peak flux ratio of the [\ion{O}{III}] $4960$\,\AA\, and $5008$\,\AA\, components are fixed at the expected $1$:$3$ ratio and the width and velocity offsets are set to be equal\footnote{For J$003136$+$003421$, a significantly better fit ($\Delta \chi^2_{\nu} \sim 25\%$) is obtained when the peak flux ratio constraint relaxed; the peak ratio of the best-fitting model is $1$:$2.13$.}.

In $62$ objects with very weak [\ion{O}{III}] (mean ${\mathrm EQW}\sim2$\,\AA) we find that the Gaussian model has a tendency to fit features to the noise. 
In some cases this can lead to large errors on the [\ion{O}{III}] line properties. 
To avoid this problem, we instead fit a fixed [\ion{O}{III}] template to the spectra, with the normalisation of this template the only free-parameter in the fit.
This template is generated by running our line-fitting routine on a median composite spectrum that we have constructed from the $268$ quasars with reliable [\ion{O}{III}] line measurements.  
The spectra used to construct the composite were first de-redshifted and continuum- and \ion{Fe}{II}-subtracted.  
The models we use to fit [\ion{O}{III}], and the numbers of quasars each model is applied to, are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:oiiimod}.

\begin{table}

    Template &  $62$ \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table} 

In Figure~\ref{fig:example_spectrum_grid} we show example fits to $15$ objects, chosen at random. 
The median reduced-$\chi^2$ value is $1.31$ and, in general, there are no strong features observable in the spectrum-minus-model residuals.

\subsection{\hans}
\label{sec:hamodel}

There are $165$ quasars in our sample with spectra covering the \ha emission-line. 
In Section~\ref{sec:ch4_redshifts}, we use the peak of the \ha emission as one estimate of the quasar systemic redshift. 
In this section we describe how the \ha emission was modelled. 

The continuum emission is first modeled and subtracted using the procedure described in Section~\ref{sec:ha}. 
We then test five different models with increasing degrees of freedom to model the \ha emission. 
The models are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:hamod}. 
They are (1) a single broad Gaussian; (2) two broad Gaussians with identical velocity centroids; (3) two broad Gaussians with different velocity centroids; (4) two broad Gaussians with identical velocity centroids, and additional narrower Gaussians to model narrow \ha emission, and the narrow components of [\ion{N}{II}]\ll$6548,6584$ and [\ion{S}{II}]\ll$6717,6731$; (5) two broad Gaussians with different velocity centroids, and additional narrower Gaussians. 
If used, the width and velocity of all narrow components are set to be equal in the fit, and the relative flux ratio of the two [\ion{N}{II}] components is fixed at the expected value of $2.96$.

In order to determine which model is selected for each spectrum, we use the following procedure.  
Each of the five models are fit to every spectrum and the reduced-$\chi^2$ recorded.
Initially, the model with the smallest reduced-$\chi^2$ is selected. 
We then measure how the reduced-$\chi^2$ changes as the complexity of the model is decreased (i.e. considering the models in Table~\ref{tab:hamod} in descending order). 
If it results in an increase in the reduced-$\chi^2$ which is less than $10$ per cent relative to the best fitting model, then the simpler model is selected.

All [\ion{O}{III}] line properties are derived from the [\ion{O}{III}]\l$5008$ emission, but, as described above, the kinematics of [\ion{O}{III}]\l$4960$ are constrained to be identical in our fitting routine. 

We do not attach any physical meaning to the individual Gaussian components used in the model. 
Decomposing the [\ion{O}{III}] emission into a narrow component component at the systemic redshift and a lower-amplitude, blueshifted broad component is often highly degenerate and dependent on the spectral S/N and resolution. 
Furthermore, there is no theoretical justification that the broad component should have a Gaussian profile.  

We therefore choose to characterize the [\ion{O}{III}] line profile using a number of non-parametric measures, which are commonly used in the literature \citep[e.g.][]{whittle85,zakamska14,zakamska16}. 
A normalised cumulative velocity distribution is constructed from the best-fitting model, from which the velocities below which $5$, $10$, $25$, $50$, $75$, $90$, and $95$ per cent of the total flux accumulates can be calculated. 
These velocities are then adjusted so that the peak of the [\ion{O}{III}] emission is at $0$\,\kms. 

We calculate the velocity-width containing $90$ per cent of the flux $w_{90}$ by rejecting $5$ per cent of the flux in the blue and red wings of the profile $w_{90}\equiv v_{95} - v_{5}$).
We also calculate $w_{80}$ ($\equiv v_{90} - v_{10}$) and $w_{50}$ ($\equiv v_{75} - v_{25}$).
$w_{90}$ is relatively most sensitive to the flux in the wings of the line, whereas $w_50$ is relatively most sensitive to the flux in the core.  
In terms of the FWHM, $w_{50} \simeq {\mathrm FWHM} / 1.746$, $w_{80} \simeq {\mathrm FWHM} / 0.919$, $w_{90} \simeq {\mathrm FWHM} / 0.716$, assuming a Gaussian line profile.  

All of the derived parameters we have calculated are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:nlr-specmeasure}.

\subsection{Deriving uncertainties on parameters}

To estimate realistic uncertainties on emission-line properties derived from the best-fitting model we use the same Monte Carlo approach described in Section~\ref{sec:ch3_param_errors}. 
Very briefly, random simulations of each spectrum are generated.
Our fitting-procedure is run on each simulated spectrum, and the errors on the line parameters are estimated by measuring the spread of the parameter distribution from the ensemble of simulations. 
In a slight modification of the procedure in Section~\ref{sec:ch3_param_errors}, the error is defined as half the the $68$ ($84$ - $16$) percentile spread in the parameter values. 

\subsection{Low EQW [\ion{O}{III}]}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/chapter04/eqw_cut.pdf} 
    \caption[{Uncertainty in $v_{10}$ as a function of the EQW, for [\ion{O}{III}].}]{Uncertainty in $v_{10}$ as a function of the EQW, for [\ion{O}{III}]. Uncertainties in $v_{10}$ are large to the left of the vertical line, at $8$\,\AA. These objects are ignored in our subsequent analysis of the [\ion{O}{III}] line shape.}     
    \label{fig:eqw_cut}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:eqw_cut} we show how the uncertainty in [\ion{O}{III}] $v_{10}$ depends on the EQW. 
As the strength of [\ion{O}{III}] decreases, the average uncertainty in $v_{10}$ increases.
When the [\ion{O}{III}] ${\mathrm EQW} > 80$\,\AA, the mean uncertainty in $v_{10}$ is $50$\,\kms; this increases to $450$\,\kms\, when $10 < {\mathrm EQW} < 20$\,\AA. 
As the EQW drops below $8$\,\AA, uncertainties in $v_{10}$ become very large (exceeding $1000$\,\kms\, in many objects). 
Clearly, the emission-line is too weak for properties - in this case $v_{10}$ - to be reliably measured in many of these objects. 
Therefore, when the [\ion{O}{III}] line properties (e.g. velocity-width, centroid) are analysed in later sections, objects with ${\mathrm EQW} < 8$\,\AA\, will be excluded. 
This leaves $226$ quasars in the sample.

    \label{fig:redshift_comparison}
\end{figure}

In this section, we compare systemic redshift estimates based on [\ion{O}{III}], \hb and \hans. 
The wavelength of each of these lines is measured at the peak of the emission and this measurement is made using the best-fitting parametric model. 
In the case of the Balmer lines, this model includes both broad and (if present) narrow emission features. 

We compare systemic redshift estimates based on [\ion{O}{III}] and \hb (Figure~\ref{fig:redshift_comparison_a}), [\ion{O}{III}] and \ha (Figure~\ref{fig:redshift_comparison_b}) and \hb and \ha (Figure~\ref{fig:redshift_comparison_c}). 
[\ion{O}{III}], \hb and \ha measurements are available for $226$, $418$ and $226$ objects respectively. 
We exclude [\ion{O}{III}], \hb and \ha measurements when the uncertainties on the peak velocities exceed $200$, $300$ and $200$\,\kms\, respectively. 
This excludes $4$, $6$ and $12$ per cent of the [\ion{O}{III}], \hb and \ha measurements respectively. 
We also exclude [\ion{O}{III}] measurements from 16 objects with very broad, blueshifted [\ion{O}{III}] emission that is strongly blended with the red wing of \hb (these objects are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:extreme_oiii}) because these redshifts are almost certainly strongly biased.
After these cuts, there are $182$, $85$ and $162$ objects being compared in samples (a), (b) and (c) respectively. 

We generate probability density distributions using a Gaussian kernel density estimator.
The bandwidth, which is optimised using leave-one-out cross-validation, is $170$, $120$ and $140$\,\kms\, for samples (a), (b) and (c) respectively. 

The systematic offset between the \ha and \hb estimates is consistent with being zero, and the scatter is $230$\,\kms. 
The scatter in these distributions is consistent with previous studies of redshift uncertainties from broad emission-lines \citep[e.g.][]{shen16b}. 
The [\ion{O}{III}] redshifts appear to be systematically offset in comparison to both \ha and \hbns, in the sense that [\ion{O}{III}] is blueshifted. 
This effect is strongest when [\ion{O}{III}] is compared to \hbns, in which case [\ion{O}{III}] is shifted by $\sim100$\,\kms\, to the blue.

\citet{hewett10} found that [\ion{O}{III}] was blueshifted by $\sim45$\,\kms\, relative to a rest-frame defined using photospheric \ion{Ca}{II}\ll$3935$,$3970$ absorption in the host galaxies of $z<0.4$ SDSS AGN. 
They also noted, as we find here, that [\ion{O}{III}] is increasingly blue-asymmetric at higher luminosities. 
Therefore, our finding is consistent with \citet{hewett10}, when the very different luminosities of the two samples are accounted for.  

This analysis demonstrates that none of the results presented in this chaper depend on whether the systemic redshift is defined using \hans, \hb or [\ion{O}{III}]. 
Accurate systemic redshift estimates are essential in a number of applications, and researchers have devoted a large amount of telescope time to obtaining near-infrared spectra to access [\ion{O}{III}] for this purpose. 
While we find a reasonable agreement between redshift estimates based on [\ion{O}{III}] and the broad Balmer lines, we also note that in XX per cent of our sample [\ion{O}{III}] is very weak or strongly blueshifted, and can not be used to measure the systemic redshift.

The $1200$\,\kms\, upper limit on the velocity width of the Gaussian functions used to model [\ion{O}{III}] is responsible for the peak at $1200$\,\kms\, in (b).}     
    \label{fig:parameter_hists}
\end{figure}

In our sample of $354$ quasars, there is a huge diversity in [\ion{O}{III}] emission properties (Figure~\ref{fig:example_spectrum_grid}). 
In Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_hists}, we present a sub-set of the measurements we have made of the [\ion{O}{III}] line.  

The strength of [\ion{O}{III}] depends on the covering factor of NLR gas, its density and ionisation parameter. 
The [\ion{O}{III}] EQW follows an approximately log-normal distribution, peaking at $17$\,\AA. 
In $10$ per cent of our sample [\ion{O}{III}] is very weak, with ${\mathrm EQW} < 1$\,\AA.  
The average [\ion{O}{III}] strength is consistent with earlier studies on smaller samples \citep[e.g.][]{sulentic04,netzer04,shen16a}.

The mean and standard deviation of the line width (characterized by $w_{80}$) is $1535\pm562$\,\kms, with a median of $1529$, minimum of $206$ and maximum of $3214$. 
This is consistent with recent near-infrared spectroscopy of $z>1.5$ quasars which often report velocity widths $\gtrsim1000$\,\kms\, \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,kim13,brusa15,shen16a}. 
For gas discs rotating in the potential of the massive galaxies line widths do not exceed $w_{80}\simeq600$\,\kms\, \citep{liu13}. 
Therefore the [\ion{O}{III}] gas cannot be in dynamical equilibrium with the host-galaxy. 
[\ion{O}{III}] emission is suppressed by collisional de-excitation in higher-density environments, and so the large velocity widths cannot be due to Doppler broadening in the BLR. 
The broad velocity widths can be understood as the result of bulk motions of the gas, possibly due to outflows. 

The [\ion{O}{III}] asymmetry is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:parameter_hists_c}. 
In $40$ per cent of the sample [\ion{O}{III}] is fit with a single Gaussian. 
The asymmetry is zero in this model and so these objects are excluded. 
For the objects fit with two Gaussians, [\ion{O}{III}] is blue-asymmetric in $90$ per cent. 
This indicates that there is an outflow component in the [\ion{O}{III}]-emitting gas, with the receeding side of the outflow presumably obscured due to the presence of dust, either in the outflow or elsewhere. 
We also find a weak anti-correlation between $w_{80}$ and the asymmetry (Spearman correlation coefficient $\rho_{\mathrm S}=\text{-}0.30$, p-value $=4e\text{-}4$), in the sense that the broaded lines tend to be more blue-asymmetric.  
Plot this? Zhang, Shen? 

\subsection{Luminosity/redshift-evolution of [\ion{O}{III}] properties}

We extend the dynamic range of our sample in terms of both luminosity and redshift the SDSS DR$7$ quasar catalogue, with properties derived by \citet{shen11}. 
There are $20\,663$ quasars in the \citet{shen11} catalogue with [\ion{O}{III}] measurements. 
The median redshift of these objects is $0.55$ and the median bolometric luminosity is $10^{45.5}$\,\ergs.

\subsubsection{Equivalent width}

\begin{figure}[t!]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/chapter04/eqw_lum.pdf} 
    \caption[{The [\ion{O}{III}] EQW as a function of the quasar bolometric luminosity for the sample presented in this chapter (blue circles) and the low-$z$ SDSS sample (grey points and contours).}]{The [\ion{O}{III}] EQW as a function of the quasar bolometric luminosity for the sample presented in this chapter (blue circles) and the low-$z$ SDSS sample (grey points and contours).

The red line shows the median [\ion{O}{III}] EQW in luminosity bins centred on $45.3$, $45.7$, $46.1$, $46.6$, $47.2$ and $47.7$\,\ergs, considering only objects with ${\mathrm EQW} > 1 $\,\AA.}     
    \label{fig:eqw_lum}
\end{figure}


Many authors have reported the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW to decrease with quasar luminosity \citep[e.g.][]{brotherton96,sulentic04,baskin05b}. 
The origin of this correlation - which is known as the [\ion{O}{III}] Baldwin effect \citep[e.g.][]{baldwin77,brotherton96,zhang11,stern12} - has not been demonstrated conclusively. 
One interpretation is that the size of the NLR increases when the quasar luminosity increases, because more ionising photons are available. 
However, beyond a certain radius there will be no more gas left to ionise, and the size of the NLR will plataeu. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:eqw_lum} we show the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW as a function of the quasar bolometric luminosity. 
Bolometric luminosity is estimated from the monochromatic continuum luminosity at $5100$\,\AA, using the correction factor given by \citet{richards06}. 
For comparison, we also show $z\lesssim1$ SDSS quasars from \citet{shen11}.  
Considering only the objects for which [\ion{O}{III}] was detected (and ${\mathrm EQW} > 1$\,\AA), we observe a modest decrease in the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW as the luminosity increases (from $18$\,\AA\, at $L_{\mathrm Bol}=10^{45.25}$\,\ergs to $12$\,\AA\, at $L_{\mathrm Bol}=10^{47.75}$\,\ergs. 

The fraction of objects with [\ion{O}{III}] ${\mathrm EQW} < 1$\,\AA is $10$ per cent in our sample, compared to just one per cent of the SDSS sample. 
If we instead define `weak' [\ion{O}{III}] emission as having an ${\mathrm EQW} < 5$\,\AA, then $22$ per cent of our high-luminosity sample is classified as such, compared to $8$ per cent of the SDSS sample. 

\citet{netzer04}, comparing the [\ion{O}{III}] properties in a much smaller sample over a comparable luminosity range, reached a similar conclusion. 
The conclusion reached by \citet{netzer04} was that the size of the NLR scaled with the square root of the luminosity of the source of ionising photons in low luminosity AGN, in line with theoretical predictions \citep[e.g.][]{netzer90}. 
However, extrapolating this relationship to high luminosity quasars leads to the prediction of enormous NLRs with galactic dimensions. 
If these NLRs had properties similar to the ones in local Seyferts, they would quickly escape the system and disappear. 
Therefore, the prediction is that no NLR emission should be observed in high-luminosity quasars, which is the case for $\sim10$ per cent of our sample. 
This means that when strong [\ion{O}{III}] is detected, it must be from denser gas. 
\citet{netzer04} suggest that this high density gas could be produced in the kilo-parsec scale nuclear regions by violent star formation.  
We find that that virtually all objects which have large \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts have very weak [\ion{O}{III}] emission. 
\todo{Does this support/contradict Netzer picture? See email from Paul.}

At very high luminosity the NLR becomes very large (e.g., Hainline et al. 2013; Zakamska et al. 2016). 
In these conditions, the NLR size-luminosity relationship flattens out (Hainline et al. 2013, 2014), and the [O iii] luminosities may become saturated as the AGN photoionizes the entire interstellar medium of the host galaxy (e.g., Hainline et al. 2013). 

The size of the narrow line region is roughly expected to scale as $L^{0.5}$ \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04}. 
However, for high luminosity quasars with strong [\ion{O}{III}] this gives NLR sizes which are unreasonably large \citep[$\sim100$ kilo-parsec;][]{netzer04}. 

I think the Netzer argument goes that the nlr size increase with luminosity because there are more ionising photons. but then you run out of nlr to ionise. the luminosity of the quasar keeps increasing but the luminosity of the nlr flattens out. so the eqw starts to decrease. but we see a huge scatter in eqw at high luminosities. we can relate this to the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift, which I don't think Netzer will have been able to.

From Shen 2016: Shen \& Ho (2014) showed that the [\ion{O}{III}] Baldwin effect is primarily driven by the flux reduction in the core component of [\ion{O}{III}] when quasar luminosity increases. A byproduct of this effect is the increase in the overall [\ion{O}{III}] width, as the broad wing component becomes more prominent at higher luminosities. 
 
\subsection{Velocity width}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering

Objects with extreme [\ion{O}{III}] profiles (Section~\ref{sec:extreme_oiii}) are shown in red. The grey dots show $z<1$ SDSS quasars. The FWHM measurements given by \citet{shen11} have been converted into equivalent $w_{80}$ values by assuming $w_{80} \simeq {\mathrm FWHM} / 0.919$. The build-up of points at $w_{80}=1300$\,\kms\, is caused by the upper-limit $1200$\,\kms\, upper-limit imposed by \citet{shen11} on the [\ion{O}{III}] FWHM.} 
    \label{fig:lum_w80}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:lum_w80} we show the [\ion{O}{III}] velocity width as a function of the quasar bolometric luminosity.
A correlation exists.
Low redshift SDSS quasars from \citet{shen11} are also shown. 
Looking at the [\ion{O}{III}] velocity width as a function of luminosity tells us about the physical drivers of the outflows observed in [\ion{O}{III}]. 
The correlation with luminosity suggests that the highest velocity outflows are associated with the most luminous AGN. 
This suggests that the outflows are driven by radiative forces. 

On the other hand, we do not find any significant correlation between the [\ion{O}{III}] velocity width and the quasar redshift. 
The lack of any evolution in typical [\ion{O}{III}] properties between $z=0$ and $z=1.5$ has previously been reported \citep[e.g.][]{harrison16}; our sample demonstates that the [\ion{O}{III}] properties do not evolve from $z=1.5$ all the way to $z=4$. 

\section{Eigenvector 1 correlations}

\subsection{EV1 trends exist in high-redshift quasars}

\begin{figure}[t!]
\centering 
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/chapter04/ev1_lowz.pdf} 
    \caption[{EV$1$ parameter space.}]{The distribution of objects in the EV$1$ parameter space. The contours and shading show low-redshift, low-luminosity SDSS AGN (with measurements taken from \citealt{shen11}) and the red circles show the high-redshift, high-luminosity objects presented in this chapter.}      
    \label{fig:ev1_lowz}
\end{figure}

The FWHM of the broad \hb emission-line and the strength of [\ion{O}{III}] and the relative strengths of optical \ion{Fe}{II} and \hb have been identified as the features responsible for the largest variance in the spectra of AGN.
These parameters form part of EV$1$, the first eigenvector in a PCA which originated from the work of \citet{boroson92}.   
The underlying driver behind EV$1$ is thought to be the Eddington ratio \citep[e.g.][]{sulentic00b,shen14}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:ev1_lowz} we show the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW as a function of the \hb FWHM and the optical \ion{Fe}{II} strength. 
The optical \ion{Fe}{II} strength is defined as the ratio of the \ion{Fe}{II} and \hb EQW, where the \ion{Fe}{II} EQW is measured between $4434$ and $4684$\,\AA.
There are $231$ objects in our sample with spectra that include \hbns, [\ion{O}{III}], and at least $>150$\,\AA\, of the $4434$-$4684$\,\AA \ion{Fe}{II} region.  
For comparison, $z\lesssim1$ SDSS quasars are also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ev1_lowz}. 
 
In our sample, these parameters follow very similar correlations to what is observed at low-redshift.
In particular, we observe a strong anti-correlation between the [\ion{O}{III}] and \ion{Fe}{II} EQW.  
The \hb FWHM are displaced to higher values, which is consistent with the high-redshift, high-luminosity sample having larger BH masses. 
Thus, we confirm earlier results using much smaller samples that suggest that the same EV$1$ correlations exist in high-redshift quasars \citep[e.g.][]{netzer04,sulentic04,sulentic06,runnoe13,shen16a}.
This suggests that similar underlying physical processes govern the spectral properties of AGN and quasars over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities. 

Like the EV$1$ parameter space, the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and EQW is a diagnostic that similarly spans the diversity of broad emission-line properties in high redshift quasars \citep{sulentic07,richards11}. 
Qualatatively, the distribution of objects in a two-dimensional projection of the EV$1$ parameter space (Figure~\ref{fig:ev1_lowz}) is very similar to the distribution of objects in the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift-EQW parameter space (Figure~\ref{fig:ev1}).

In Figure~\ref{fig:line_comparison_ha} in Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass} we showed that large \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts were only observed in objects with narrow \ha FWHM. 
We concluded that strong BLR outflows were only observed in objects radiating near the Eddington limit.  
However, we also found that many objects with similarly high accretion rates did not show evidence for BLR outflows. 

The correlation between the \ha FWHM and the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift establishes a connection between EV$1$ and \ion{C}{IV} parameters, which has previously been identified at lower redshifts \citep[e.g.][]{sulentic07}. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:} we show the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW, also so an EV$1$ parameter, as a function of the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and EQW.
Two hundred and thirteen objects are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ev1}.
Objects for which the \ion{C}{IV} line properties could not be measured reliably (see Section~\ref{sec:flagged_spectra}) have been removed. 
We consider only objects for which the \ion{C}{IV} EQW exceeds $15$\,\AA. 
The \ion{C}{IV} blueshift is measured relative to the redshift determined from the peak of [\ion{O}{III}], \hb or \hans. 
The contours show the \ion{C}{IV} line parameters of $32\,157$ SDSS DR$7$ quasars at redshifts $1.6 < z < 3.0$. 
The derivation of the \ion{C}{IV} emission properties of these objects is described in Section~\ref{sec:ch3-civmeasure}. 

The [\ion{O}{III}] EQW decreases systematically from the small \ion{C}{IV} blueshift, large EQW quadrant to the large \ion{C}{IV} blueshift, small EQW quadrant.
We previously found that, while objects with large \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts had narrow \ha emission-lines, many objects with small \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts did too. 
In contrast, Figure~\ref{fig:} demonstrates that the [\ion{O}{III}] provides a less degenerate mapping between the EV$1$ and \ion{C}{IV} parameter spaces.
Specifically, given only the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW, it may be possible to predict where an object would fall in the \ion{C}{IV} parameter space. 

The same data is shown in a two-dimensional projection of [\ion{O}{III}] EQW against \ion{C}{IV} blueshift in Figure~\ref{fig:}. 
The luminosity of the quasars is indicated by the colour of the points. 
Both the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW and the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift are known to depend on the quasar luminosity. 
However, Figure~\ref{fig:} demonstrates that the strong correlation between the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is clearly not being driven by the mutual dependence of these parameters on the luminosity. 

The mean [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is $40$\,\AA\, amongst the population of quasars with \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts $<500$\,\kms, compared to $5$\,\AA\, for quasars with \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts $>2000$\,\kms. 
In other words, the NLR emission appears to be missing in quasars with large \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts. 
One possibility is that the NLR gas is swept away on relatively short timescales by quasar outflows; this possibility is explored in more detail in Section XX.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:example_spectrum_grid_extreme_oiii} shows the spectra of $18$ objects which we visually identified as having broad, blueshifted [\ion{O}{III}] emission which is heavily blended with the red wing of \hbns. 
Because the emission is so heavily-blended, it is difficult to determine unambiguously what combination of \hbns, [\ion{O}{III}] and \ion{Fe}{II} is responsible for the unusual plateau-like emission observed in these objects. 
Therefore, uncertainties on the [\ion{O}{III}] emission properties are generally high in these objects. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:lum_w80} we show that the optical luminosities of all of these objects are larger than the sample median.
The mean luminosity of the quasars with extreme [\ion{O}{III}] emission is $10^{47.9}$\,\ergs, compared to $10^{47.2}$\,\ergs for the rest of the sample. 
Figure~\ref{fig:lum_w80} demonstrates that these quasars occupy a unique region of the $w_{80}$-L$_{\mathrm Bol}$ parameter space: $w_{80}\gtrsim1500$\,\kms\, and L$_{\mathrm Bol}\gtrsim10^{47.5}$\,\ergs. 

These [\ion{O}{III}] emission-lines are similar to the lines observed in four extremely dust-reddened quasars at $z\sim2$ recently identified by \citet{zakamska16}. 
The extreme nature of the [\ion{O}{III}] emission in these objects led \citet{zakamska16} to propose that these objects are being observed transitioning from a dust-obscured, star-burst phase to a luminous, blue quasar \citep[e.g.][]{sanders88}.
Punctuated fuelling episodes, e.g. driven by galaxy mergers, satellite accretion and even secular processes,
will lead to AGN experiencing activity-, outflow- and obscuration-dominated cycles with some overlap between phases. 
This suggests that these extreme outflows signatures are only associated with rare/short-lived phases in the AGN cycle represented by the reddened quasars and are not ubiquitous in the luminous AGN population.
The early phase of feedback is likely to highly obscured by dusty inflowing material \citep[e.g.][]{haas03}.
Quasar-driven outflows will eventually blow away the obscuring dust, revealing a luminous, relatively un-obscured quasars.  

We note that six of these objects are found within the foot-print of the FIRST radio survey. 
Of these four are radio loud (three core-dominated and one lobe-dominated). 
By comparison, the fraction of radio-loud objects in the rest of our sample is 11 per cent. 
In general, the differences between the 30 radio-loud and 197 radio-quiet sources in our sample are not large. 
The radio-loud objects have slightly broader ($w_{80}\simeq1600/1480$\,\kms) and weaker (${\mathrm EQW}\simeq14.5/13.9$\,\AA) [\ion{O}{III}]. 
However, these modest differences could be explained by the higher luminosity of the radio-loud objects ($L_{\mathrm Bol}\simeq10^{47.5/47.1}$\,\ergs).
In light of this, the high fraction of radio-loud objects amongst the quasars with broad and perculiar [\ion{O}{III}] emission is interesting. 
The disturbed gas kinematics could be induced by radio emission. 
See what \citet{mullaney13} says about this.

\subsection{Connections between [\ion{O}{III}] and \ion{C}{IV} outflows}

    \caption[{The relation between the blueshifts of \ion{C}{IV} and [\ion{O}{III}].}]{The relation between the blueshifts of \ion{C}{IV} and [\ion{O}{III}]. We see a correlation between the \ion{C}{IV} and [\ion{O}{III}] blueshifts, albeit with a significant scatter.}     
    \label{fig:oiii_civ_blueshifts}
\end{figure}

In Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass} we found that \ion{C}{IV} is blueshifted realtive to the systemic redshift in a large majority of luminous, high-redshift quasars. 
In a sub-set, the blueshifting of \ion{C}{IV} can reach many thousands of \kms. 
This is strong evidence that quasars are capable of driving fast outflows, at least over the sub-parsec scale of the BLR. 
In the present chapter, we have found that outflows in the NLR, as indicated by broad velocity-widths and asymmetries in [\ion{O}{III}], are similarly ubiquitous in the luminous quasar population. 

In Section~\ref{sec:ch4_low_high_ev1}, we found that the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW has a very strong dependence on the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift.
The mean [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is $40$\,\AA\, amongst the population of quasars with \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts $<500$\,\kms, compared to $5$\,\AA\, for quasars with \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts $>2000$\,\kms. 
This establishes a connection between gas in the broad and narrow line regions. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:oiii_civ_blueshifts} we show the the [\ion{O}{III}] blueshift as a function of the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift, for the objects where [\ion{O}{III}] is detected with EQW$>8$\,\AA. 
The [\ion{O}{III}] blueshift is defined as $v_{10}$([\ion{O}{III}]) - $v_{\mathrm peak}$([\ion{O}{III}]) whereas the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift is defined as $v_{50}$(\ion{C}{IV}) - $v_{\mathrm peak}$([\ion{O}{III}]) with the \ion{C}{IV} line measurements taken from Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass}.
We do not show objects for which the errors on the [\ion{O}{III}] and \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts exceed $250$ or $125$\,\kms\, respectively. 
These objects, shown in the top two panels of Figure~\ref{fig:oiii_civ_blueshifts}, have a similar dyamic range to the main sample, meaning our results should not be biased by their exclusion.  
We also remove the objects with extreme [\ion{O}{III}] emission, because the systemic redshift determined from the peak of the [\ion{O}{III}] emission is strongly biased in these objects. 

Because of the strong anti-correlation between the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW, removing objects with weak [\ion{O}{III}] eliminates most of the objects with large ($>2000$\,\kms) \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts.  
Nevertheless, [\ion{O}{III}] appears to be more blueshifted in quasars with large \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts.
Although the scatter is large, the correlation appears to be significant ($\rho_{\mathrm S}=0.46$, p-value $=6e\text{-}7$). 
This suggests a direct connection between the gas kinematics in the broad and narrow line regions. 

We considered a number of of alternative approaches to parametrising both the [\ion{O}{III}] line shape and the systemic redshift. 
As expected, very similar trends are observed when the [\ion{O}{III}] line shape is parametrised using $v_{25} - v_{\mathrm peak}$, $v_{50} - v_{\mathrm peak}$, $w_{80} = v_{90} - v_{10}$, or the relative asymmetry $R$.
The same trend is also observed when the systemic redshift is defined using the peak of the \hb emission. 

The blueshifting of \ion{C}{IV} is known to correlate with luminosity \citep{richards11}.
In [\ion{O}{III}], the blueshifted wing becomes relatively more prominent as the luminosity of the quasar increases \citep{shen14}. 
Therefore, it is plausible that the correlation between the \ion{C}{IV} and [\ion{O}{III}] blueshifts is a secondary effect that is driven by the correlation of each with the luminosity. 
However, no strong luminosity-dependent trends are apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:oiii_civ_blueshifts}. 

It has been known for some time that the [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is anti-correlated with the strength of optical \ion{Fe}{II}, and this trend is thought to be driven by the Eddington ratio. 
\citet{shen14} showed that the amplitude of the core [\ion{O}{III}] emission decreases faster than the wing component as the Eddington ratio increases. 
Therefore, the [\ion{O}{III}] emission is weaker and more blueshifted in high accretion rate quasars.  
In Chapter~\ref{ch:bhmass} we found that all quasars with strong BLR outflows have high Eddington ratios. 
In this Section, we show that the \ion{C}{IV} and [\ion{O}{III}] blueshifts are directly linked. 
This suggests a direct connection between the gas kinematics in the broad and narrow line regions. 

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Static NLR is removed by outflows}

Is the AGN NLR absent in objects where outflows have reached kilo-parsec scales, sweeping up the low-density material responsible for the [\ion{O}{III}]-emission?
If the BLR outflows can escape, they are very fast and wouldn't need long to clear out the NLR gas. 
Estimate a time-scale for how long the NLR would take to be cleared given typical size of galaxy and velocity of outflow.
It would take $10^6$ years for an outflow travelling at $3000$\,\kms\, to reach $3$\,kiloparsc.

\section{Independent Component Analysis}

In this section, we consider an alternative approach to the analysis presented in the bulk of this chapter. 
We use an independent component analysis (ICA) to separate the spectrum into a linear combination of statistically independent sub-components. 
Each individual spectrum can then be reconstructed with a linear combination of these components. 
The advatange of this approach (cf fitting multiple Gaussians) is its lack of sensitivy to S/N. 
Furthermore, by equating components with physical properties of interest we can use the component weights in place of more commonly used emission-line parameters to understand the physical processes occurring in these quasars. 

Would also though put in the information about using the SDSS objects to generate the component set and how one probably expects the high-luminosity sample to include spectral diversity not present in the SDSS-sample [and hence in the ICA components]. 
You can, as you have drafted, then say how the analysis could be improved - better training set, removing the component cross-talk (I can tell you how this can be achieved),\dots

If the [\ion{O}{III}] emission is confined to a relatively small number of components can then recover emission. 

Encouraging, but we do need a better training set (training set doesn't span the diversity of properties we see in the high-luminosity sample).

Issues with the parametric model fitting approach adopted above include sensitivity to S/N. 
We also found the empirical template to be a poor match to the \ion{Fe}{II} emission observed in a number of quasars. 

\subsection{The technique}
 
ICA is a blind source separation technique for separating a signal into linearly mixed statistically independent subcomponents. 
Unlike the more widely-used principle component analysis technique, ICA produces non-negative components which allows for a physical interpretation of the components and weights.  
ICA has been successfully applied to model the spectra of emission-line galaxies \citep{allen13}. 
The quasar spectra can be thought of as a set of observations, $\bm{x}$, which are made up of statistically independent components, $\bm{c}$, that are combined by some mixing matrix, $\bm{W}$:

\begingroup\makeatletter\def\f@size{11}\check@mathfonts
\begin{eqnarray}
    \bm{x} = \bm{W}\bm{c}
\end{eqnarray}
\endgroup

\noindent ICA reverses this process and describes how the observed data are generated. 
Both the independent components and the mixing matrix are unknown, but can be found by solving:

\begingroup\makeatletter\def\f@size{11}\check@mathfonts
\begin{eqnarray}
    \bm{c} = \bm{W}^{-1}\bm{x}.
\end{eqnarray}
\endgroup

\noindent The components were solved for using a sample of $2,154$ SDSS quasars at redshifts XX. 
\todo{Ask Paul for details.}
At these redshifts the SDSS spectrograph covers the rest-frame region XX-XX\,\AA\, where \hb and [\ion{O}{III}] lie. 
SDSS quasar sample which was used to generate the ICA components. 
I would at that point herald that the limited spectral diversity in the SDSS sample is likely to prove an issue, even if the ICA aproach looks promising.
We can solve this by finding some more representative broad [\ion{O}{III}] lines in SDSS from which to derive the components. 

The individual spectra were first adjusted to give the same overall shape as a model quasar template spectrum.
Six positive independent components and four lower-amplitude `correction' components that could be negative were found to be sufficient to reconstruct the spectrum, without over-fitting. 
Each quasar spectrum $x_j$ can then be represented as a linear combination of the independent components: 

\begingroup\makeatletter\def\f@size{11}\check@mathfonts
\begin{eqnarray}
    x_j = \sum_{i=1}^{10} c_{ij}W_{ij}
\end{eqnarray}
\endgroup

\subsubsection{Fitting procedure}

Each of the individual ICA components has been adjusted to give the same overall shape as a quasar template spectrum. 
We approximate the overall shape of this template by fitting a single power-law to emission-line free windows at $4200$-$4230$, $4435$-$4700$ and $5100$-$5535$\,\AA. 
We then flatten each of the ICA components by dividing by this power-law. 
An identical process is performed on each spectrum we fit, so that both the components and the spectrum to be fitted have essentially zero large-scale slope. 
For each quasar in our sample we perform a variance-weighted least-squares minimisation to determine the optimum value of the components weights.
The first six component weights are constrained to be non-negative, and the fit is performed in logarithmic wavelength space, so that each pixel corresponds to a fixed velocity width.   
The relative shift of the ICA components is also allowed to vary in the optimisation procedure, to account for errors in the systemic redshifts used to transform the spectra into rest-frame wavelengths. 

\subsection{Quality of fits}

In general, the ICA components are able to reconstruct the spectra of the objects in our sample. 

We also find that that in some cases, the ICA reconstructions are superior at modelling the \ion{Fe}{II} emission than the \citet{boroson92} template. 

\subsection{Physical interpretation of ICA components}

    \label{fig:mfica_components}
\end{figure}

Although the ICA analysis is not based on any physics, there appears to be a direct correspondence between the individual non-negative components and the different emission features which contribute to the spectra (Figure~\ref{fig:mfica_components}). 
This correspondence is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:icacomps}. 
The component $w_1$ seems to correspond to \ion{Fe}{II} emission, the components $w_2$ and $w_3$ to broad \hb emission, the components $w_4$ and $w_5$ to narrow [\ion{O}{III}] emission at the systemic redshift, and the component $w_6$ to broad, blueshifted [\ion{O}{III}] emission.

\subsubsection{Reconstructing the [\ion{O}{III}] profile}

In the previous approach we measured non-parameteric line parameters from the Gaussian model. 
We would like to be able to take a similar approach here. 
This requires us to first reconstruct the [\ion{O}{III}] emission. 
The vast majority of the [\ion{O}{III}] emission is in just three of the ICA components; the remaining three contribute very little. 
Therefore, we can set the first three weights to zero to leave only the [\ion{O}{III}] emission. 
However, there is some cross-talk between components, particularly in the wings of the line. 
This is something we can address in the future (ask Paul how).

    \label{fig:oiii_core_strength_blueshift}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:mfica_component_weights} we show the relative weights of each of the six positive ICA components. 
Also shown are the same measurements for a sample of low-redshift, low-luminosity AGN. 
We want to examine whether or not there are systematic differences between these two samples. 
\todo{Paul: Paragraph belongs with material above}

We see that [\ion{O}{III}] core emission is weaker in the more luminous sample, but the strength of the wing component is similar. 
\citet{shen14} showed that the strength of the core [\ion{O}{III}] component decreases with quasar luminosity and optical \ion{Fe}{II} strength faster than the wing component, leading to overall broader and more blueshifted profiles as luminosity and \ion{Fe}{II} strength (or \ion{C}{IV} blueshift) increases. 
\citet{shen14} suggested that a stable NLR is being removed by the outflowing material. 
Similarly, \citet{zhang11} found that the more the peak of the [\ion{O}{III}] line is blueshifted, the more the core component decreases dramatically, while the blue wing changes much less. 
Therefore, there is an anti-correlation between the strength of the core component and the relative strength of the wing component (Figure~\ref{fig:oiii_core_strength_blueshift}). 

To show this phenomenon more clearly, we plot the relative [\ion{O}{III}] strength and the [\ion{O}{III}] wing/core ratio in the high/low luminosity samples (Figure~\ref{fig:oiii_core_strength_blueshift}). 
We see that [\ion{O}{III}] is weaker in the high luminosity sample, but that the wing component is much stronger relative to the core component. 
\todo{Similar to behaviour of \ion{C}{IV}? Would suggests that the mechanism producing the two correlations is the same}. 

\subsubsection{EV1 correlations}

    \label{fig:mfica_composites}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:civ_blueshift_oiii_strength} we show how the [\ion{O}{III}] strength varies as a function of the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift. 
There is a very well defined relation: when \ion{C}{IV} is strongly blueshifted [\ion{O}{III}] is very weak. 
This is very similar to what we found when we used Gaussian functions to model the emission. 
The correlation between \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is shown in a different way in Figure~\ref{fig:mfica_composites}. 
Here we divide our sample into four bins according to the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift. 
From the quasars in each \ion{C}{IV} blueshift bin we then find then generate an ICA spectrum using the median weights from each quasar. 
The differences in the spectra as a function of the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift are dramatic. 
[\ion{O}{III}] becomes progressively weaker and more blueshifted.
The anti-correlation with \ion{Fe}{III} and the blue-ward \ion{Fe}{II} also clear, but there is no change in the redward \ion{Fe}{II}. 
ICA looks promising, and in the future, the weights could be added to EV$1$, or even replace the traditional components. 

\subsection{Future work}

Pros:

It is less sensitive to the spectral S/N, and the component weights do not need to be constrained. 
It is therefore much simpler to apply than fitting multiple Gaussians. 

Cons:

The components were calculated using a set of lower-redshift, lower-luminosity AGN, and quasar spectra are known to vary systematically as a function of luminosity. 
For example, the [\ion{O}{III}] line is typically broader in more luminous quasars. 
Because there are so few objects with very broad [\ion{O}{III}] in the low-redshift sample, the ICA reconstruction fails to reproduce the broadest [\ion{O}{III}] profiles in our sample. 

Cross-talk between components. 









We see a correlation between the [\ion{O}{III}] velocity width and asymmetry. 
As the line gets broader it gets more blue-asymmetric. 
One interpretation of this is that the strength of the narrow core is decreasing, leading to a broader and more blueshifted profile \citep[e.g.][]{shen14}. 

















\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}

\item [\ion{O}{III}] is broad, blueshifted. Show that [\ion{O}{III}] velocity-width is correlated with the quasar optical luminosity. We interpret the broad, blueshifted wing as being to outflowing ionised gas, suggesting that kilo-parsec-scale outflows in ionized gas are common in this sample of high-luminosity, high-redshift quasars.

\item [\ion{O}{III}] EQW is weakly anti-correlated with the luminosity, but strongly correlation with the \ion{C}{IV} blueshift. 

\item Weak correlation between \ion{C}{IV} blueshift and [\ion{O}{III}] blueshift, but this could arise because the [\ion{O}{III}] core is decreasing faster than the wing component \citep[e.g.][]{shen14}. 

\end{itemize}


At fixed luminosity, I find that as the blueshift of the \ion{C}{IV} emission increases, the [\ion{O}{III}] emission becomes weaker and more blueshifted, and disappears entirely in quasars with the most extreme \ion{C}{IV} blueshifts.
