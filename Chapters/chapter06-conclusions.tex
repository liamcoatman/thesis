\section{Future: Red quasars}

Punctuated fuelling episodes, e.g. driven by galaxy mergers, satellite accretion and even secular processes,
almost certainly lead to AGN experiencing activity-, outflow- and obscuration-dominated cycles with some overlap between phases. 
However, quantitatively, it remains unclear how these phases relate to the fundamental properties of the accreting black-hole (e.g.  mass (M$_{\rm{BH}}$), bolometric luminosity (L$_{\rm{bol}}$) and Eddington ratio (L/L$_{\rm{Edd}}$) and the elements of the non-spherical geometry).
