We have explored relationships between BLR outflows, NLR outflows and hot dust emission. 

Put some stuff from research proposals here 

\section{Future: Red quasars}

Punctuated fuelling episodes, e.g. driven by galaxy mergers, satellite accretion and even secular processes,
almost certainly lead to AGN experiencing activity-, outflow- and obscuration-dominated cycles with some overlap between phases. 
However, quantitatively, it remains unclear how these phases relate to the fundamental properties of the accreting black-hole (e.g.  mass (M$_{\mathrm{BH}}$), bolometric luminosity (L$_{\mathrm{bol}}$) and Eddington ratio (L/L$_{\mathrm{Edd}}$) and the elements of the non-spherical geometry).
