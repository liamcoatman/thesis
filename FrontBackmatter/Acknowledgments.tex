\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors Paul Hewett and Manda Banerji for their advice, encouragement and unwavering support.
Paul and Manda have been endlessly patient and always approachable -- thank you for investing in me not only as a scientist but as a person.

I am indebted to Gordon Richards, whose enthusiasm and ideas have contributed much to this work.
Special thanks also to Joe Hennawi and Xavier Prochaska for providing me with some remarkable data.
I am grateful to the Science and Technology Facilities Council for funding my work.

I would like to thank all of my friends at the Institute of Astronomy and Robinson College.
In particular, my time in Cambridge would not have been the same without my housemates Prash and Gus. 
Finally, I owe an enormous debt to my family - Mum, Dad, Anna, Emily and Robbie - for their unfailing love and support.
